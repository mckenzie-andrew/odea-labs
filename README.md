Welcome to the workshop of **The Data Engineering Commons**. This repository contains the hands-on exercises, code samples, and Docker environments that accompany the **[Curriculum](https://github.com/DECommons/curriculum)**.

## 🛠️ Philosophy: "Break It to Learn It"
We believe the only way to learn Data Engineering is to get your hands dirty. These labs are designed to be run locally (or in a cloud shell) using containers, ensuring that everyone has the same environment regardless of their OS.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `/foundations`: SQL, Python for DE, and Shell scripting basics.
* `/pipelines`: Building your first ETL pipelines.
* `/infrastructure`: Docker-compose files for spinning up databases, Airflow, etc.
* `/capstones`: Large, multi-stage projects.

## ⚡ Prerequisites
To use these labs effectively, you will need:
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Recommended).
* Git.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to the specific lab folder (e.g., `cd foundations/lab-01`).
3.  Follow the `README.md` inside that specific folder.

*Note: These labs are currently under active construction.*
