$ $he Build: Data Engineering Labs
Welcome to the **Workshop** of [The Open Conduit](https://github.com/OpenConduit).

This repository contains the hands-on exercises, "broken-by-design" scenarios, and containerized infrastructure that accompany [The Specs (Curriculum)](https://github.com/OpenConduit/curriculum).

## 🛠️ Philosophy: "Stress Test Everything"
We believe that you cannot learn Data Engineering by reading about it. You must build it, and more importantly, you must **fix it when it breaks**.

These labs are designed to be run locally on your own machine. We do not provide a sanitized browser sandbox because real engineering happens in the terminal, not in a web app.

## ⚡ Tooling Requirements
To operate these labs, your local environment must be equipped with:
- Docker Desktop (The engine).
- VS Code (The workbench) (or any suitable alternative).
- Git (The version control).

## 🚀 Initialization Protocol
1. **Clone the Facility**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenConduit/labs.git
```
2. **Enter the Zone**: Navigate to the specific lab folder you are working on (e.g., cd foundations/lab-01).
3. **Follow the SOP**: Read the README.md inside that specific folder for deployment instructions.
